## Iterations of the Game
Within the last year, this game as gone through three versions of the game.

The first version of the game was really simple. It used JavaScript with no frameworks or UI libraries. One of my first projects I worked on when I wanted to learn JavaScript.

About four months from then, I rewrote the entire project in an effort to learn React better. I used Material UI as my UI library and it didn't look that bad. It took about three days, but it looked better than the original.

After another five months, I decided to rewrite the game without a UI library. This was the first project in my journey to learn to create and execute designs I made. For this project, Dave Caruso made me a design, and I executed it. In my opinion, I don't think it turned out that bad.
